    difference between address and address payable:
    address: It is a 20 byte value that does not allow any arithmetic operations.
    address payable: It is a 20 byte value that allows arithmetic operations.
    It is also capable of sending and receiving Ether via transfer and send functions.

/*
    difference between bytes and string:
    bytes: It is used to store raw byte data. It is similar to byte[] in other programming languages.
    bytes is a fixed-length array. It means that once it is created, it cannot be resized.
    bytes is not iterable. It means that we cannot loop through it.
    bytes does not have too many built in functions.
    they are more low level, that's why they are typically used to manipulate or sotre binary data, such as cryptography hashes.
    string: It is used to store UTF-8 data. It is similar to string in other programming languages.
