/*
    Mapping
        Mapping is a key-value pair data structure that is used to store data in the form of key-value pairs.
        It is similar to the dictionary in C#.
        just works like arrays, but instead of using indexes, we use keys to access the values.
        the keys can be of any data type, but the values must be of the same data type.
        
        NOTE: ARRAYS ARE DIFFERENT THAN MAPS

    Nested Mapping
        Nested mapping is a mapping that has another mapping as its value.
        like nested arrays, we can have nested mappings. we can have a mapping as the value of another mapping.
        in this case, we need to specify the key of the first mapping, and then the key of the second mapping.
